# MyReads Project

Author - **Bogdan Pasterak**

Based on the start template for the final evaluation project of the Udacity React Fundamentals course, I built functional applications.

The base project was downloaded from [Udacity GitHub](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
